Ever been blocked while trying to download songs and SFXs from the Music Library on a GDPS? Well, if you're a GDPS owner, this should do the trick!
Simply run this program on a different server, change the URL from RobTop's music library to yours, and done!

Feel free to make pull requests if you notice any flaws, would really help!
